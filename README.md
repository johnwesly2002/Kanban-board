# Kanban Board Application

A Kanban board built with **Vite**, **React** (JavaScript), and **Drag-and-Drop** functionality. The application allows users to manage tasks with three phases: **Todo**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. Users can add new tasks and drag them between these phases.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add tasks to the board with necessary details.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between "Todo", "In Progress", and "Done" phases using drag-and-drop.
- **Task Management**: Each task is categorized based on the current status (phase).
- **Responsive**: Designed to work on desktop and mobile screens.
